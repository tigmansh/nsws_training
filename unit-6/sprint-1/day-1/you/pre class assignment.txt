üí°What is RDBMS?

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a software system that is used to manage and organize data in a relational database. A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables, with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns.

An RDBMS provides a set of tools and features for creating, modifying, and querying relational databases. Some of the key features of an RDBMS include:

1. Support for a standard query language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language).

2. Ability to define relationships between tables, which allows for the creation of complex data models.

3. Support for transactions, which ensures that data is stored and retrieved reliably.
