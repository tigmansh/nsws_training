ðŸ’¡ What are the key requirements and goals for the API?

1. The API should be user-friendly, reliable, and easy to use for developers.
2. It should be highly scalable and able to handle a large number of requests.
3. The API should provide the necessary functionality required by the application, such as CRUD events.
4. It should be designed to work across multiple platforms and devices.
5. Security and authentication should be enforced to protect user data.

ðŸ’¡ What are the different endpoints that you would include in the API, and what methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) would you use for each endpoint? List them.

Based on the requirements, the following endpoints could be included in the API:-

1. POST /api/user/signup: Creates a new user with the provided information.
2. POST /api/user/login: Logs in the user with the provided credentials and returns a JWT token for authentication.
3. POST /api/user/logout: Logs out the current user.
4. DELETE /api/calendars/:id/events/:eventId: Deletes the specified event on the specified calendar.
5. PUT /api/events/:eventId: Updates the specified event on the specified calendar.
6. GET /api/getMeetings: get all the meetings scheduled for a particular day.
7. GET /api/meeting/:id: get the detail about a particular meeting.

ðŸ’¡ What data structures (e.g., JSON, XML, MYSQL) would you use to represent the data exchanged between the API and the client?

For the data structures, I would use MySql to represent the data exchanged between the API and the client. 
1. MySql is lightweight.
2. Easy to read.
3. Supported by most programming languages like JAVA, RUBY, JAVASCRIPT etc..
4. It is possible to create relationships between different data tables.
5. Queries of MYSQL is easy to learn and understand in comparison of MongoDB and many other databases.

ðŸ’¡ How would you ensure the security and authentication of the API, such as using OAuth or other methods so that only authorized users or applications can access the API's resources?

To ensure the security and authentication of the API, I would use OAuth 2.0. OAuth 2.0 is a widely used authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access user data without sharing their credentials. It provides secure access to protected resources by generating access tokens, which expire after a set amount of time. OAuth 2.0 is widely supported by many web applications, including Google, Facebook, GitHub and Twitter.

We can also use JWT Authorization and Bcrypt package to protect our user's passwords by hashing and other sensitive information.

ðŸ’¡ How would you handle error reporting and logging to help developers identify and resolve issues with the API that may occur during API usage?(hint - make use of HTTPS codes properly.)

For error reporting and logging, I would use HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call. The most common HTTP status codes are 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, and 503 Service Unavailable. These codes help developers identify and resolve issues with the API. Additionally, I would log any errors or exceptions to a centralized logging system.

ðŸ’¡ How would you test and validate the API design to ensure it meets the requirements and goals?

To test and validate the API design, I would use a combination of unit testing and integration testing. Unit testing involves testing each component of the API in isolation to ensure that it works as expected. Integration testing involves testing the API as a whole to ensure that it meets the requirements and goals. Additionally, I would use tools such as Postman or Swagger to document and test the API endpoints.
